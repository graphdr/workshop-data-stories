## Welcome

The workshop has three sessions focusing on different aspects of storytelling with data. 

**Session 1: Limitations of common graph types**

In the first session we demonstrate avoiding the perceptual limitations of common graph types to    
  
- Improve perception of stories in the data
- Make it easier to reason quantitatively about the data
- Thereby enhancing our credibility with the audience

**Session 2: Expanding your graphical repertoire**

In the second session we illustrate a repertoire of graph types and how they are suited to specific data structures. The session should encourage you to: 

- Understand the structure of one's data
- Explore different graph types suited to the data. 
- Keep reading and learning&mdash;an unfamiliar design may be just what you need.

**Session 3: Critical thinking about visual information&mdash;a case study** 

In the third session we study the visual rhetoric of a deliberate visual lie in the pursuit of restricting reproductive rights. We focus on 

- How the authors abuse the conventions of visual rhetoric to serve their rhetorical goals  
- What legitimate stories these data tell
- What legitimate questions the data raise
