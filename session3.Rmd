**Critical thinking about visual information&mdash;a case study** 

In the third session we study the visual rhetoric of a deliberate visual lie in the pursuit of restricting reproductive rights. We focus on 

- How the authors abuse the conventions of visual rhetoric to serve their rhetorical goals  
- What legitimate stories these data tell
- What legitimate questions the data raise
