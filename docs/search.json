The iterative process we\r\ndeveloped to “find the story” in our data has been instrumental in\r\nshaping my approach to data graphics. You can read more about our\r\nresearch at https://midfield.online/.\r\n\r\nI occasionally write about visual rhetoric, graph design, and R on my\r\nData Stories blog.\r\nOur day 3 case study is built on one of those essays.\r\nMusic\r\nMy dad was a guitar player and taught me my first chords. I’ve been\r\nsongwriting and performing since my teens. I posted some draft tracks to\r\nSoundCloud.\r\n\r\nA favorite musical pilgrimage is the annual Swannanoa Gathering near\r\nAsheville, NC in late July.\r\nWork life\r\nI am a graduate of California State University, Northridge (1991),\r\nand the University of Washington (1993, 1995), all in mechanical\r\nengineering. I taught at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology from\r\n2000-2020. My favorite courses were design, system dynamics, measurement\r\nsystems, and data visualization. I retired from teaching in 2020.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nblog https://graphdr.github.io/data-stories/\r\nrepo https://github.com/graphdr\r\nmail\r\ngraphdoctor@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
