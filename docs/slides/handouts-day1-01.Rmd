# `r "\U00A7"` Effective alternatives to pie charts 








## Judging pie slices is a low-accuracy task[^1]

- Fill in the blanks with your visual estimates of each pie slice. 

- Total should be 100%

![](img/handout-01-01.png){width="140%"}    












## Judging values along a common axis is a high-accuracy task

```{marginfigure, echo = TRUE}
![](img/pie-preview.png){width="50%"}    
```
`r margin_note("The data from the pie chart is shown below as dots along a common scale.")`

- The same data is displayed along a common scale.  

- Make new visual estimates (fill in the blanks). 

```{r fig.height = 0.3}
put_gap()
```

![](img/handout-01-02.png){width="150%"}

```{r fig.height = 1}
put_gap()
```












## 3D effects distort our judgment even further[^1]

- Fill in the blanks with your visual estimates of each pie slice 

- Total should be 100% 

![](img/handout-01-03.png){width="150%"}    











## Again, a common scale improves our visual judgments

```{marginfigure, echo = TRUE}
![](img/three-d-pie-preview.png){width="50%"}    
```
`r margin_note("The data from the pie chart is shown below as dots along a common scale.")`

- The same data is displayed along a common scale. 

- Make new visual estimates (fill in the blanks). 

```{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

![](img/handout-01-04.png){width="150%"}

```{r fig.height = 1}
put_gap()
```










# `r "\U00A7"` Effective alternatives to bar charts 








## 3D effects always distort our judgment[^1]

- Fill in the blanks with your visual estimates of each bar length 

![](img/handout-01-05.png){width="150%"}
 
```{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```










## Same data---without 3D effects---along a common scale

```{marginfigure, echo = TRUE}
![](img/three-d-bar-preview.png){width="50%"}    
```
`r margin_note("The data from the 3D bar chart is shown below as dots along a common scale.")`

- The same data is displayed along a common scale 

- Make new visual estimates (fill in the blanks). 

```{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

![](img/handout-01-06.png){width="150%"}

```{r fig.height = 1}
put_gap()
```









## With a zero baseline and no 3D effects, bars are OK

- Bar charts must have a zero baseline to avoid deception.

- Ordering rows by the data values facilitates visual comparisons.

- The only information in the bar is the position of its end point. The bar itself is superfluous.

- Dot charts allow direct visual comparison of quantities.

- Dot charts are effective replacements for pie charts and bar charts.

```{marginfigure, echo = TRUE}
Default bar chart:
![](img/handout-01-08.png)
Ordered by magnitude:
![](img/handout-01-09.png)
Omitting the fill color:
![](img/handout-01-10.png)
Produces a dot chart:

```


## Notes

```











# `r "\U00A7"` Aligning the design to the story

## Survey: “What was your reason for taking this postdoc?”[^2] 

Before we can talk about what the chart *says*, we have to agree on what it *shows*.

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

![](img/stacked-bar-04.png){width="150%"}



`r newthought("")`Write your responses below. 

- What does a color represent?

````{r fig.height = 1}
put_gap()
```

- What does a single color-segment of a bar represent?

````{r fig.height = 1}
put_gap()
```

- What does the changing height over time of a segment represent?

````{r fig.height = 0.5}
put_gap()
```








## What ideas are conveyed by the chart?[^2]  

We agree on what the chart *shows*; now we can consider what it *says*.  

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

![](img/stacked-bar-04.png){width="150%"}

`r newthought("")`Write your responses below. 

- Describe a trend for one of the six reasons for obtaining postdoc training.

````{r fig.height = 1.5}
put_gap()
```

- Compare two of the reasons over time.  

````{r fig.height = 1.5}
put_gap()
```

- Describe the main idea this chart conveys to you. 

````{r fig.height = 0.5}
put_gap()
```
















# What can we say about the variables?[^2]   

Choosing an effective chart design depends in part on what variables you have.   

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

![](img/stacked-bar-04.png){width="150%"}

````{r fig.height = 0.4}
put_gap()
```

`r newthought("Fill in the blanks")` to begin summarizing the data structure.  

1. Time (discrete years) is one categorical variable.`r margin_note("Note that discrete time units are not 'continuous', so the time units here are a categorical (not quantitative) variable.")`

2. The other categorical variable is ___________________________ . 

3. The quantitative variable is ___________________________ .

4. Which is the independent variable? ___________________________ . 

````{r fig.height = 2.3}
put_gap()
```

 











# The appropriate design for a time series is a line graph[^2] 

Separating the reasons into individual panels clarifies the data

````{r fig.height = 0.1}
put_gap()
```

![](img/handout-01-13.png){width="125%"}

- Describe the main idea this chart conveys to you.


````{r fig.height = 2}
put_gap()
```














# Conventions of the box-and-whisker plot

Designed to show a summary of the distribution of a single quantitative variable. 

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

![](img/handout-01-14.png){width="75%"}

````{r fig.height = 0.5}
put_gap()
```














# Our final design shows distributions of annual percentages[^2] 

![](img/handout-01-15.png){width="130%"}

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

- Describe the main idea(s) this chart conveys to you.

````{r fig.height = 4.5}
put_gap()
```












# `r "\U00A7"` Advice from experts

Match the expert to the advice.[^3][^4][^5][^6]  

`r newthought("Fill in the blanks")` with letters A--D. 

```{r}
x <- wrapr::build_frame(
  "Expert", "Letter", "Emphasizes the importance of"|
  " ", " ", " "|
  "A. Alberto Cairo"      , "______" , "message"|

  "B. Jean-luc Doumont"   , "______" , "variables"|
  " ", " ", " "|
    
  "C. Stephanie Evergreen", "______" , "revealing the complex"|

  "D. Edward Tufte"       , "______" , "knowing your main point"|
  " ", " ", " "|

```







# Ideas to consider

- Characterize the data structure and content

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

- Explore a story's context, causality, and complexity

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

- Align visual and verbal logic by revising iteratively

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

- Edit to suit the rhetorical goals for each audience

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

- Control every pixel---avoid thoughtless conformity

````{r fig.height = 0.2}
put_gap()
```

- Question are you seeing only what you want to believe?
