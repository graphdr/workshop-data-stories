**Limitations of common graph types**

In the first session we demonstrate the perceptual limitations of common graph types and suggest more effective alternatives.

The rationale behind alternative designs is illustrated with the goals of 
  
- Improving perception of stories in the data
- Making it easier to reason quantitatively about the data
- Enhancing our credibility with the audience

**Materials**

- [worksheets](slides/handouts-day1-01.pdf)  I suggest you have a printed copy of these worksheets to write in during the workshop. We have a number of think-write-share activities that for many people work best in writing.
