**Expanding your graphical repertoire**

In the second session we illustrate a repertoire of graph types and how they are suited to specific data structures. The session should encourage you to: 

- Understand the structure of one's data
- Explore different graph types suited to the data. 
- Keep reading and learning&mdash;an unfamiliar design may be just what you need.
