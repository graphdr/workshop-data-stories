**Expanding your graphical repertoire**

In the second session we illustrate a repertoire of graph types and how they are suited to specific data structures and answering specific types of questions.

The session should encourage you to: 

- Understand the structure of your data
- Understand the type of question the data can answer 
- Explore different graph types suited to the data and the question 
- Keep reading and learning&mdash;an unfamiliar design may be just what you need


**Materials**

- [worksheets](slides/handouts-day2-01.pdf)  I suggest you have a printed copy of these worksheets to write in during the workshop. We have a number of think-write-share activities that for many people work best in writing.
